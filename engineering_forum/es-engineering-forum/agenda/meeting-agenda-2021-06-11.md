## Notes
* Security Scan in Ingka Git - We , in Engineering Collaboration had to make our repos private cause there were passwords/tokens found in commit history. The credntials have been invalidated and the history cleaned as well. To adhere to Innersource, we would like to make our repos default , but we would need to do an exhaustive scan in all our repos. 

* WoW with timezone difference - The difference in timezone between coworkers located in various geographical location can be both challening and blessing. Discussion on ways or working around that. 

* Perfomance test - Awareness about Performance / NFR tests

* Tool for EF Meeting documentation - Move to Confluence/ Github works just fine/ New tool?
